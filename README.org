* My Mathematical Library

This library is mostly a wrapper of existing excellent numerical libraries
such as [[http://www.netlib.org/lapack/][LAPACK]] and [[http://www.netlib.org/blas/][BLAS]]. 

** Contents Summary

*** Directory ~Fortran/~
Contains the Fortran source code of numerical libraries.

*** Directory ~FortranProgrammingGuide~
Contains my coding style of Fortran.

*** File ~.gitignore~
As shown by its name.

*** File ~README.org~
This very file.

** Library Components

*** Dense Matrix Class
The ~denseMatrix~ class is able to automatically assign matrix data type with
2d array and automatically assign matrix to array. Moreover, it is able to manipulate
matrix in a modern way similar to NumPy and MATLAB. The test.f90 provides a
test subroutine for this class.
